## Introduction
Like many programmers my passion for computers spawned from videogames. Not only playing videogames, but learning how they worked.
At the age of 12 I started learning Java to make mods to my favorite game, minecraft. After a year of struggling to understand the
concepts I now use everyday, I found a mentor at ECB minecraft network, an established senior programmer for one of the largest hotel
chains in America. He is the author of most of the code in the ECB github repository, and he helped me establish the good code practices
I still use today. With a mentor, I was able to learn much faster and was eventually contributing my own code to ECB projects following the
standards that he had set. I also learned the various technologies needed to manage a game-server and website, including but not limited to:
Linux command line, TMUX, Redis, SQLite, and networking (IP addresses, submasks, domains, SSL encryption).
